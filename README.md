# Lab17: Web Scraping

* Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites. The web scraping software may directly access the World Wide Web using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or a web browse
* Web scraping is the process of using bots to extract content and data from a website
* Unlike screen scraping, which only copies pixels displayed onscreen, web scraping extracts underlying HTML code and, with it, data stored in a database.
* Example: Use the API of the website (if it exists). For example, Facebook has the Facebook Graph API which allows retrieval of data posted on Facebook. Access the HTML of the webpage and extract useful information/data from it. This technique is called web scraping or web harvesting or web data extraction.

* It is not illegal unless it is mentioned in the term of services of the website
